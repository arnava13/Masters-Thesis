    "**Core question:**\n",
    "> How do EU ETS carbon market stringency interventions affect both verified CO₂ emissions and satellite-derived NOx emission proxies around major industrial emitters?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual Outcomes:**\n",
    "1. **ETS CO₂** (ground-truth): Verified annual emissions from EU ETS registry\n",
    "2. **Satellite NOx** (proxy): Beirle-style flux-divergence NOx estimates from TROPOMI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions / hypotheses:**\n",
    "- *H1:* Allocation shortfall (ratio < 1) induces facilities to reduce combustion, lowering both CO₂ and NOx.\n",
    "- *H2:* The magnitude of emission reduction correlates with plant characteristics (fuel type, capacity) and local geography.\n",
    "- *H3:* Treatment effects may differ between ground-truth CO₂ and noisy satellite NOx due to measurement error attenuation."

    "### Treatment (Causal Target)\n",
    "- **Policy $P_{it}$**: EU ETS stringency at the plant–year level, measured by the\n",
    "  allocation ratio (free allocation / verified emissions). Values < 1 indicate the\n",
    "  facility must purchase additional allowances, creating abatement incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Covariates\n",
    "- **Plant characteristics $X_{it}$**: Time-varying capacity (MW) and fuel mix shares.\n",
    "  Used as controls for **BOTH outcomes**.\n",
    "- **Geographic context $G_i$**: High-dimensional AlphaEarth embeddings (64-dim) encoding\n",

    "- **$U_{it}$**: **Plant-level time-varying unobservables**—the key identification challenge.\n",
    "  Includes dispatch/utilization, maintenance status, operational efficiency changes.\n",
    "- **$U_{rt}$**: Region–time effects (electricity demand, fuel prices, regional policy enforcement).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dual Outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ETS CO₂** is ground-truth but may be subject to reporting incentives\n",
    "2. **Satellite NOx** is independent but noisy (~35-45% uncertainty)\n",
    "3. Consistent effects across both outcomes strengthen causal claims\n",
    "4. Divergent effects may reveal measurement error attenuation in NOx\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with the DAG: $G_i \\to Y^{NOx}_{it}$ only, not $G_i \\to Y^{CO2}_{it}$."

    "\n",
    "1. **Dispatch as confounder**: Regional demand → higher dispatch → more emissions → lower $R_{it}$.\n",
    "   Same demand → more combustion → higher NO₂. This creates spurious correlation.\n",

    "2. **Dispatch as mediator**: Policy affects dispatch via carbon costs in bids (higher costs → higher bids →\n",

    "3. **Facility×Year FE infeasible**: Would absorb all within-facility-year variation, including treatment.\n",

    "### Our Solution: Region×Year FE\n",

    "Region×Year FE absorbs the *common regional component* of $U_{it}$ (since dispatch responds to\n",

    "## 4. Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD: NOT POSSIBLE\n",
    "### **These cells have been kept for completeness/future work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially planned to complement the TWFE analysis with the **Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021)** estimator, which addresses potential TWFE bias when treatment timing varies and effects are heterogeneous. However, this approach is **not feasible** for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: No Pre-Treatment Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "CS-DiD requires observing units *before* they first receive treatment to establish parallel pre-trends. Defining treatment as `eu_alloc_ratio < 1`, the \"cohort\" is the first year a facility crosses this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The EU ETS has operated since 2005.** By the start of our panel (2018), most facilities that would ever face allocation shortfalls were already treated:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cohort (First Treatment Year) | Facilities | % of Ever-Treated |\n",
    "|------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **2018** (first panel year) | 386 | **84.5%** |\n",
    "| 2019 | 20 | 4.4% |\n",
    "| 2020 | 9 | 2.0% |\n",
    "| 2021 | 38 | 8.3% |\n",
    "| 2022-2023 | 4 | <1% |\n",
    "\n",
    "With **84.5% of treated facilities already treated in 2018**, there are no pre-treatment observations for the vast majority of units. The CS-DiD estimator cannot identify treatment effects without this variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why TWFE Still Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Our continuous TWFE specification does **not** require discrete cohort definitions. It exploits:\n",
    "- **Within-facility variation** in allocation ratios over time\n",
    "- **Continuous treatment intensity** rather than binary treatment status\n",
    "\n",
    "This is valid because:\n",
    "1. The allocation ratio varies year-to-year within facilities\n",
    "2. Fixed effects absorb time-invariant confounders\n",
    "3. Region×Year FE absorbs regional time shocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the panel backward to **2013-2017** (EU ETS Phase 3) would capture actual first-treatment timing for most facilities, enabling proper event-study analysis with pre-treatment observations."
