    "> How do EU ETS carbon market stringency interventions affect both verified CO₂ emissions and satellite-derived NOx emission proxies around major industrial emitters?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual Outcomes:**\n",
    "1. **ETS CO₂** (ground-truth): Verified annual emissions from EU ETS registry\n",
    "2. **Satellite NOx** (proxy): Beirle-style flux-divergence NOx estimates from TROPOMI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions / hypotheses:**\n",
    "- *H1:* Allocation shortfall (ratio < 1) induces facilities to reduce combustion, lowering both CO₂ and NOx.\n",
    "- *H2:* The magnitude of emission reduction correlates with plant characteristics (fuel type, capacity) and local geography.\n",
    "- *H3:* Treatment effects may differ between ground-truth CO₂ and noisy satellite NOx due to measurement error attenuation."

    "| Variable | Absorbed By | Rationale |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| $U_i$ (time-invariant) | Facility FE | Technology, location, baseline efficiency |\n",
    "| $U_{rt}$ (region-time) | Region×Year FE | Demand shocks, fuel prices, regional policy |\n",
    "| $X_{it}$ (observed) | Controls | Capacity, fuel mix |\n",
    "| $G_i$ (geography) | AlphaEarth embeddings | Land use, infrastructure, climate context, **urbanization** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Urbanization is NOT a Separate Control\n",
    "\n",
    "We collect urbanization data (GHSL SMOD degree) for **heterogeneity analysis**, but do NOT include it as a regression control because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Already encoded in AlphaEarth**: The 64-dimensional embeddings capture land use, built-up area, and urbanization patterns implicitly. Adding an explicit urbanization variable would introduce **multicollinearity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No identification benefit**: Urbanization is time-invariant and absorbed by facility FE. Even without embeddings, it would not improve identification of the treatment effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proper use**: Urbanization enables **split-sample heterogeneity analysis** (urban vs rural subsamples) and **descriptive statistics**, without contaminating the main specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Do NOT Control For: $U_{it}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant-level time-varying unobservables ($U_{it}$) include dispatch, maintenance, and efficiency changes.\n",
    "We deliberately do not control for these because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dispatch as confounder**: Regional demand → higher dispatch → more emissions → lower $R_{it}$.\n",
    "   Same demand → more combustion → higher NO₂. This creates spurious correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dispatch as mediator**: Policy affects dispatch via carbon costs in bids (higher costs → higher bids →\n",
    "   lower dispatch probability). Thus $P_{it} \\to U_{it} \\to Y_{it}$. Controlling for $U_{it}$ blocks\n",
    "   this pathway and biases $\\hat{\\beta}$ toward zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Facility×Year FE infeasible**: Would absorb all within-facility-year variation, including treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactive FE risky**: Estimating facility-specific loadings on common factors may open\n",
    "   backdoor paths if loadings correlate with allocation mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Solution: Region×Year FE\n",
    "\n",
    "Region×Year FE absorbs the *common regional component* of $U_{it}$ (since dispatch responds to\n",
    "regional demand/prices) without estimating facility-specific parameters. The identifying variation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Within the same region and year, do facilities with different allocation ratios show different NO₂?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves **facility-specific deviations** in $U_{it}$ as residual confounding (e.g., idiosyncratic\n",
    "outages, plant-specific demand). These are plausibly second-order and orthogonal to allocation ratio\n",
    "conditional on capacity and fuel mix controls."

    "### Interpretation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ETS CO₂ effects** are more reliable (ground-truth administrative data)\n",
    "2. **Satellite NOx effects** may be attenuated due to ~35-45% measurement error\n",
    "3. **Consistent signs** across outcomes strengthen causal claims\n",
    "4. **Detection limit filter** (0.11 kg/s conservative) may introduce selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Run Data Pipeline.ipynb** to generate satellite outcome data\n",
    "2. **Install packages**: `pip install pyfixest csdid geopandas`\n",
    "3. **Heterogeneity analysis** by fuel type, country, capacity\n",
    "4. **Sensitivity analysis** with different treatment thresholds\n",
    "5. **Compare ETS vs NOx** on intersection sample"
